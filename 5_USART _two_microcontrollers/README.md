# Project: UART Communication Between Two Atmega324p Microcontrollers

## The aim
USART stands for Universal Synchronous/Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter, and it is a communication interface module available in the Atmega324p microcontroller. The USART module allows the Atmega324p microcontroller to communicate with other devices, such as other microcontrollers, computers, or peripherals, using serial communication protocol. The USART module in the Atmega324p microcontroller supports both synchronous and asynchronous serial communication. The aim of this application is to establish a serial communication between two Atmega324p microcontrollers. Master will send input value read from Dip switch device to Slave. The slave microcontroller receive data via UART communication then print it on an 16x2 LCD display. The Embedded C is applied to compile program in Eclipse IDE for Embedded C/C++ Developers programming environment. Proteus software is utilized for designing this circuit.

## Hardware Requirements

```
      1- Two Atmega324p microcontrollers
      2- 16x2 LCD display
      3- Dip switch
      4- Five LEDs
```
