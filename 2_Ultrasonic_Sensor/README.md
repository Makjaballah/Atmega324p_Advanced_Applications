# Project: Ultrasonic Module HC-SR04 interfacing with Atmega324p Microcontroller

## The aim
The aim of this project is to show how to measure the distance to an object by interfacing ultrasonic module HC-SR04 with the Atmega324p microcontroller and print the distance on an 16x2 LCD display. The Embedded C is applied to compile program in Eclipse IDE for Embedded C/C++ Developers programming environment. The Proteus simulation software is used for simulating the system components and verifying their functionality.

## Hardware Requirements

```
      1- Atmega324p microcontroller
      2- 16x2 LCD display
      3- Ultrasonic HC-SR04 Module
      4- Proteus Debuggers and Virtual Instruments Mode (Virtual Terminal, Oscilloscope)
```
## Drivers

```
      1_MCAL
          -> UART
      2_HAL
          -> LCD_Drive
```
## Simulation of the main circuit diagram using Proteus Design Suite software
