# Atmega324p_Advanced_Applications

This is Atmega324p Advanced Applications repo. In this repository, I will give some examples for advanced applications with the Atmega324p microcontroller.
The Atmel® picoPower® ATmega324P is a low-power CMOS 8-bit microcontroller based on the AVR® enhanced RISC architecture. By executing powerful instructions in a single clock cycle, the ATmega324P achieves throughputs close to 1MIPS per MHz. This empowers system designer to optimize the device for power consumption versus processing speed.
This repository covers many projects using most features of the the Atmega324p microcontroller such as GPIO, ADC, UART, I2C, SPI, LCD, analogue inputs, and others. All the projects in this repository have been fully tested and are working used the Proteus Design Suite software. 
The following sub-headings are given for each project where possible:
```
     1- Project Title
     2- Description
     3- Aim
     4- Circuit Diagram
```
