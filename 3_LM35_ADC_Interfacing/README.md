# Project: Temperature reading from LM35 temperature sensor with ADC module of the Atmega324p Microcontroller

## The aim
LM35 is analog temperature sensor capable of measuring the temperature between -55 to 150 degree Celsius. It outputs an analog voltage value that is 10 mV per degree Celsius proportionally. The aim of this project is to show how an analogue input of the Atmega324p microcontroller can be used to read the temperature from an analogue temperature sensor chip. The Embedded C is applied to compile program in Eclipse IDE for Embedded C/C++ Developers programming environment. Proteus software is utilized for designing this circuit.

## Hardware Requirements

```   
      1- Atmega324p microcontroller
      2- Four Seven-Segment LED Displays
      3- LM35 Temperature Sensor
```

## Simulation of the main circuit diagram using Proteus Design Suite software
